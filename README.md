## Introduction 

User Story

AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase


## Pseudocode 

To fulfill the Challenge, you’ll need to do the following:

    Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

    Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

    Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

    Deploy the application to Heroku.
